# Contributing

We welcome contributions! As this is an Excel-based analysis project, the workflow is slightly different.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Download the Analysis Workbook** (`analysis/Causal_Inference_Complete_Analysis.xlsx`)
3. **Make your improvements** in a specific sheet or add a new sheet.
4. **Document your changes** clearly in a new `Change Log` sheet or updated documentation.
5. **Open a Pull Request** describing your methodology improvements.

## Suggestions
- Adding Python/R implementations of the same analysis to compare results.
- Improving visualization dashboards within Excel.
- Translating the causal inference logic to other tools.
