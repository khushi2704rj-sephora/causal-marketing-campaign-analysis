# AB Testing & Uplift Modeling for Marketing Campaigns

This repository showcases end-to-end **A/B testing**, **uplift modeling**, and **causal inference** on real marketing campaign data, including impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, and cost.

Key highlights:
- Design and evaluation of **A/B experiments** for ad/algorithm changes.
- **Propensity score matching** to correct for selection bias in non-randomized tests.
- **Heterogeneous treatment effects** by segment and channel to find where the variant truly wins.
- **Revenue and ROI lift calculation** to translate test results into business impact.
- Excel-first workflow so stakeholders can fully trace logic, formulas, and decisions.
